This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## What it does

CryptoHub allows people to sign up for a paper trading account, which is an account where aspiring traders can place trades without placing real capital on the line so they can hone their skills. CryptoHub allows traders to trade over 100 coins as their position sizes are displayed to them.

## How I Built it
This web app was made using Next.js for the front end and Firebase for authentication and the database. There was also Tailwindcss used for styling.

## What's next for CryptoHub?
I plan to help further the security on the website, make UI changes to make the website look more appealing as well as potential data visualizations such as graphs, and a few features for convenience such as an overall account size description and a filter method for the coins.
